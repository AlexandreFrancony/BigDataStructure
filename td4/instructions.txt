Submit a package with the aggregate operators which automatizes the previous steps:
• Operator:
– aggregate with sharding;
– aggregate without sharding.
• Each takes as input:
– The targeted collection (link with the structure/object defined in the program / JSON Schema in Sec-
tion 2.7);
– The grouping key(s) (link with statistics is necessary);
– The expected output format (involved keys);
– An optional filtered key.

• Provides in output:
– The number of output documents / distinct key values (and size);
– The costs.
• It should be recommended to provide functions that compute different type of costs which estimates the vol-
ume of data, shuffle, reduce, etc.
Test your program with the aggregate queries provided during the practice work (and the previous JSON Schema).
As usual, you will be evaluated on your knowledge about the program you have developed during the next
session. You have to be able to explain it.


For each query, give:

Database : DB1 - DB5
Sharding keys : Involved sharding key(s)
Index : Implied/Required index locally on each server
Algo : Map/Reduce & Nested Loop & Shard / Index / Full scan
Costs :
