Submit a package with several operators on DVL which automatizes the previous steps:
• Operators:
– Filter with sharding;
– Filter without sharding;
– Nested loop with sharding;
– Nested loop without sharding.
• Each takes as input:
– The targeted collection (link with the structure/object defined in the previous program / JSON Schema);
– The expected output format (involved keys);
– The filtered key;
Optionally, the filter selectivity could be provided (by default, take the one computed in Section ??).
• Provides in output:
– The number of output documents (and corresponding size);
– The costs.
• It should be recommended to provide functions that compute different type of costs which estimates the vol-
ume of data, etc.
• Not required: a program that translates a query into operators and parameters (it can be a bonus);
Test your program with the filter & join queries provided during the practice work (and the previous JSON
Schema).
As usual, you will be evaluated on your knowledge about the program you have developed during the next
session. You have to be able to explain it.


For each query, give:

Database : DB1 - DB5
Sharding keys : Involved sharding key(s)
Index : Implied/Required index locally on each server
Algo : Map/Reduce & Nested Loop & Shard / Index / Full scan
Costs :
    time :
    carbon footprint :
